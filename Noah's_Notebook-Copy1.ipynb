Living in central Oakland, I have firsthand experience of living in the 7th most dangerous and I have never felt unsafe at all. I feel safety is a major part of neighborhoods, and looking at the crime density per area, it seems Hays is the safest. It is also interesting how much crime rates can differ in such a short area."
